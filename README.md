# steam-reviews
This is a script to scrape game reviews on Steam.
For the sake of randomness, I randomly choose a user's uid as the start user(i.e., the first user of all the users). After that, I randomly choose one of the user in the first user's firendlsit and repeat the process for many times(depends on how large data do you need) so that I can get the enough data. After all the user ids have been collected successfully, I can finally start to use loops to get all the users' reviews.
